            <h4>Spring Core</h4><p>The term Spring Core refers to the central part of the Spring Framework. The core is the cornerstone which everything else is built off of.</p><p>This is a graphic published by Spring showing how Spring Core relates to other components in the Spring Framework.</p><p><img src="https://d2vvqscadf4c1f.cloudfront.net/ibPsBYm1SSqBB19peBb1_spring-overview.png" style="max-width: 100%;"> </p><h4>Spring Beans</h4><p>Central to Spring Core and the Spring philosophy in general are Spring Beans. In contrast to EJB, the Spring Framework is designed from the core to use POJO's (Plain Old Java Objects), or 'Spring Beans'. Spring Beans are meant to be simple Java objects.</p><p>In practice, Spring Beans are one of the true beauties of the Spring Framework. Spring Beans are meant to be simple. Thus, you as a developer are discouraged from creating overly complex objects.</p><p>Robert C Martin is known for coming up with the " Single Responsibility Principle", which is a highly accepted fundamental of Object Oriented Programming. Martin argues your classes should have one, and only one reason to change. Since Spring encourages you to program with simple POJOs you will find programming with the Spring Framework naturally encourages adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.</p><h4>Dependency Injection(DI)</h4><p>Dependency Injection is a significant strength of the Spring Framework, and was largely absent from the original EJB specification. The current EJB specification does include Dependency Injection, which some feel was influenced by the success of Spring. Dependency Injection is a software design pattern where dependent objects are injected into your class.</p><p>A good example of Dependency Injection in action would be when you have a web controller handling a form post. Following the Single Responsibility Principle, you don't want your controller class interacting with the database. Instead, you would have some type of service class for that. Thus your controller code would deal with the form post, and then call a method on the injected class. The controller doesn't need to care, nor worry about the database connection, connection pooling or what tables need to be updated. Likewise, the service does not need to know anything about the web request. The service doesn't need to care that the data came from a form post or a JSON string.</p><h4>Inversion of Control (IoC)</h4><p>A core concept of the Spring Framework is Inversion of Control, or also known as IoC. For application developers, this is the true strength of the Spring Framework. Through the concept of Inversion of Control, the Spring Framework manages the software components and injection of components into dependent objects.</p><p>Its very easy to get Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control confused. Remember, Dependency Injection is exactly as it sounds. Dependencies are being injected into your class. Inversion of Control is the actual injection of the dependencies. This is a subtle, yet important difference.</p><h4>Dependency Injection and IoC for the Application Developer</h4><p>As an application developer these are two very powerful concepts. You will compose your objects to be loosely coupled. Each will have a very specific purpose.</p><p>For example, a very common design pattern in building web applications is to use a controller for interacting with the web tier, and inject a service object for interacting with the database tier. As I said above, the controller does not need to know anything about the database, and the service object does not need to know anything about the web tier.</p><p>Through the power of Dependency Injection and IoC, when you're testing your controller, you can inject a mock database service in a test configuration, and the actual database service in the production configuration.</p><p>This concept goes beyond simple testing. This greatly impacts the maintainability of your application. For example, if a change is needed to the database tier, no changes are required in the controller object.</p><h4>Spring Context</h4><p>The Spring Context is what brings everything together. It looks at the class files of your source code, ie the Spring Beans, then looks at the configuration of the context and wires up the environment. Spring will ensure your classes are injected with the specified dependencies.</p><h4>SpEL - Spring Expression Language</h4><p>Also with in the Spring Core is SpEL, or Spring Expression Language. This is a concise language used to give you a great deal of flexibility when configuring the Spring Framework.</p>
