common problem ?

Ans:when check for lastName  is validated  white spaces also passed throught validation process.
	So,sloution is:
		@InitBinder
		
		-@InitBinder annotation works as a pre-processor
		-It will pre-process each web request to our controller
		-Method annotated with @InitBinder is executed

		-We will use this to trim Strings	
		   > Remove leading and trailing white space
		-If String only has white spaces...trim it to null
		-Will resolve our validation problem .
